ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹ Computer Systems student at the Federal Fluminense University.

ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š Currently, I work in the Supply Chain sector at Shullemberg, SLB One Subsea. I am responsible for automating processes throughout the business area, including RPA, data extraction from SAP, BI, and the internet, as well as data processing, transformation, and visualization. I use Python and VBA scripts and work with databases, Dataverse, and SharePoint.

ðŸ”­ My current project involves implementing solutions to automate SAP data collection, integrate it with supplier information, and provide better visualization and tracking of all purchase orders in the company.

ðŸŒ± As for programming languages, the choice depends on the project at hand. I have experience with Python, using the three main libraries for data extraction, processing, and visualization: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn. Additionally, I have knowledge in SQL, MySQL, CSS, Javascript, and some Java. I also have a reasonable understanding of pentesting out of sheer curiosity.
 
ðŸ“« You can reach me via email, which you can find on my profile.
