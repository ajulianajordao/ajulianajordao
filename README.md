👋 Hello, I am a Computer Systems student at the Federal Fluminense University and I am passionate about data engineering!

💻📊 My main focus is on developing software that covers the entire process of data collection, transformation, and visualization.

🔭 Currently, I am working on implementing solutions to automate data collection and streamline data transformation using Python and Business Intelligence tools like Power BI.

🌱 I am constantly learning new skills and tools to improve my knowledge and capabilities in the field of data engineering.

👯 I'm always looking to collaborate with other professionals in the data engineering field, and I'm open to discussing ideas and sharing knowledge. 💬 Feel free to ask me about anything related to data engineering, from web scraping to dashboard design.

🤔 I am also looking for help and guidance from experienced professionals in the field to continue growing my skills and knowledge.

📫 You can reach me via email, which you can find on my profile.
